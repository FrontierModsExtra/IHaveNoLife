    "description": "Before the Cataclysm, you had no life.  You'd spend most of the day in a dark, dank room, surrounded with empty packs of chips, fat-stained packaging from your favorite fast-food franchise, plastic cups, and...  is that a bottle of moisturizer on your desk?  As such, stepping outside is a danger for you: any direct contact with sunlight will hurt your skin (with even cloudy or foggy conditions posing a chance of damage), and touching grass even though thick boots or layers of clothes will poison you.  How you've managed to survive this far is a mystery.  Surviving further will certainly prove a challenge.",
